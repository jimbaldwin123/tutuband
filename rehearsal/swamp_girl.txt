Where the crane flies through the marshes
where the turtles sun their shells
where the water rat goes swimming
that is where our swamp girl dwells.

where the sunlight never wanders
where the moonlight never falls
where the water's black as a devil's track
that is where our swamp girl calls.

what did she say there, the girl with the golden hair
to make me follow her down there?
how did she look, when she took me by the hand?

tonight my hair will float in the water
and the gold will no longer shine
it will spread like a fan in the water
while I make a mysterious sign

(we have seen that sign before.)

My eyes are like a whiporwill
My eyes are like a fawn(?)
Her eyes are like a diamondback
That stretches in the dawn.

Yes you will see the swamp girl 
when cold black clouds fill the sky
and if you see her believe me you must flee her
never follow her disillusioned lies.

oh will you go with the girl with the golden hair
down where her work is done
will you embrace the night 
and turn your back on the sun?

I'll say it's better there in the water
where it's cool and calm and serene.
I will call you down to the water
to a world made of emerald green

(we have heard that call before.)

I can hear it when I'm weary
I can hear it when I'm ill
I can hear it when the joy of living 
seems to have lost its thrill

I can hear it when I'm weary
I can hear it when I'm ill
I can hear it when the joy of living 
seems to have lost its thrill

Oh the swamp girl lives inside of me
and she leaves me pale and worn
she taunts me, dares me, then she tears me
like paper dolls are torn.

Calling, come to the deep
where your sleep is without a dream
Calling, come to the deep
where your sleep is without a dream

Come with me (follow the swamp girl)
Come with me (follow the swamp girl)
Come with me 
Come with me-ee-ee
