oh, say can you see
by the dawn's early light 
what so proudly we hailed
at the twilights last gleaming 

whose broad stripes and bright stars
through the perilous night 
o'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming

and the rocket's red glare
the bombs bursting in air
gave proof through the night 
that our flag was still there

o say does that star spangled banner yet wave
o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
