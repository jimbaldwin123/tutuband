<p>
	Girls in the shower wash their face and hands<br />
All the water finds a place to go<br />
Never touch the radio, oh-ho, in the shower<br />
Girls in the shower<br />
<br />
From the kitchen to your room<br />
From the cupboard to the sink<br />
from the window to the floor<br />
We go, oh-ho<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
From your buttons to your socks<br />
From my jacket to my shoes<br />
From your earrings to your dress<br />
We go, oh-ho<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
From your elbow to your knees<br />
From my forehead to my nose<br />
From your nipples to your toes<br />
We go<br />
<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
And I watch my sperm go swirling swirling swirling down<br />
And round and round<br />
And down and around<br />
And down the drain<br />
Through miles of tubing underground<br />
To pollinate albino alligator eggs<br />
The [xxx] cracks cracks cracks<br />
Through shells<br />
The [xxx]<br />
The tube's too small<br />
Breaking pipes to back up drains<br />
The fluid rushing, pushing upwards<br />
A gushing [xxx] surge to flow through streets<br />
And lick its foam on new-made high ground shores<br />
And nothing's dry!<br />
<br />
Chorus
