<h2>Peach Pit</h2>


<pre>
The peach pit said to the apple core
The color of our skin doesn't matter any more.
Oh ho ho, can't you see
The color of our skin doesn't matter to me.

<pre>
Said the choo-choo train to the railroad track.
Don't care if the passengers are white or black.
Ah ha ha, it's so plain
You can learn brotherhood from a railroad train.
