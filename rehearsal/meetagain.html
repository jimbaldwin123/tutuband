<h2>We'll Meet Again</h2>


<pre>
We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when.
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.
Keep smilin' through, just like you always do.
Til the blue skies draw the dark clouds far away.
</pre>
<pre>
And won't you please say hello to the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singin' this song...
</pre>
<pre>
We'll meet again, etc.
