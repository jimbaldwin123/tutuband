You start to think small, now you gotta think smaller.
What the quarter used to buy it's now a dollar
You've grown too tall no need to grow taller.
It just starts with rain to make an ocean's water.

chorus

You used to think fat now you gotta think skinny
Gotta sell that Bently for an Austin Mini.
A 40 hour week now takes 60
You're lucky if you earn 40 pounds 60.

chorus

Bridge:
You don't need cash like capitalism
You don't need a pipe like liberalism
You don't aspirin like rheumatism
You don't need a brother like nepotism
You don't need a pipe like liberalism

You don't line up like Communism
You don't sign up like Socialism
You don't bone up like the Catechism

There's no more magic on the magic bus
The solution to this depends on us
It takes too much money to dress up preppy
Think biodegradable not excessive energy

Big Big Big gotta get Small Small Small
Turn the volume back to save one and all 
Slack of on the throttle, eat a little less
Minimalism will get us out of this mess
